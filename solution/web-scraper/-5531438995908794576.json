Rich, poor, young, old. Some know a lot about mental health, while others still see depression as just a phase of youth.\n\nMy trip had a hidden agenda - a concert promoting awareness of children's and adolescents' mental health (by FOSA Foundation). I joined forces with social activist, and together we delivered a speech on future technologies and their impact on our psyche.\n\nI often discuss mental health, even here on LinkedIn. However, it usually reaches the same audience. \u2757 You \u2757 Those reading this text right now. Founders, investors, journalists, employees of large corporations... Does this group need such education? Still, yes. However, it's still a kind of information bubble. If we want to be effective (and that's what it's all about), we need to step out of it and reach out to a wider audience.\n\nAnd to truly influence public awareness, we need to engage various stakeholders - governments, foundations and associations, media, but also work organically, at the grassroots level.\n\nI think I don't have any call to action here, but I just wanted to share my piece of art..\n\n________\n\n\n\nPS Yes!
