## Issue

Phishing poses a pervasive challenge for many companies. A commonly employed strategy to combat this issue involves training employees to recognize phishing attempts. Many organizations implement systems that simulate fake phishing emails to assess employees' ability to discern them. However, these simulated phishing attempts often lack authenticity and are easily identifiable due to improper preparation. Our solution addresses this challenge by providing a sophisticated anti-phishing training tool.

## Our solution

Our application enables companies to send customized fake phishing emails tailored to individual recipients, facilitating the evaluation of employees' ability to distinguish genuine emails from fraudulent ones. These emails are crafted using data gathered about the recipient, which may be sourced from social media or internal company information. Additionally, our tool incorporates an evaluation system to assess employee responses to the simulated phishing attempts. Upon reaching a predefined threshold, employees are directed to appropriate training courses. Furthermore, our project includes a user-friendly admin interface for managing and conducting tests, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the anti-phishing training process.
